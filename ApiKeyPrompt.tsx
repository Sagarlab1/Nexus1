// FIX: Implemented a placeholder component to resolve module errors.
import React from 'react';

// This component is intentionally left blank to comply with the requirement
// of not prompting the user for an API key. The key should be managed
// exclusively through environment variables.
const ApiKeyPrompt: React.FC = () => {
  return null;
};

export default ApiKeyPrompt;
